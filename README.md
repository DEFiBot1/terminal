The DEFiBot handles the smart contracts of decentralized exchanges directly, rather than their human-driven websites. This allows it to execute trades much faster than a human can. The bot uses a unique, specially trained neural network to track thousands of options in search of the best arbitrage deals. And it will always beat any trader who is simply not physically capable of such analysis.
